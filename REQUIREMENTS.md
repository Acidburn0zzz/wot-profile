# Requirements from WG participants for the profile

Please put your requirements into the sections of the document and mark it with your company name to make sure
we discuss with the appropriate contributors.

### Interoperability (Oracle, Intel)

### Limit Complexity (Oracle)

### Human readability (Oracle)

### Developer guidance (Fujitsu)
This may be a topic for wider consideration in the WoT group.
A profile can help to explain what to implement.

### Composable profiles (Intel)
How does a composition model work?

### Multiple profiles (Intel)

### Identification of profiles (Intel)
Need to add a mechanism to identify which profiles are described in a TD.

### Profile should define a finite set of features and capabilities to implement by the consumer. (Intel, Oracle)

### Limit resource consumption (Intel, Oracle)

### Follow Security and Privacy Best Practices
Profiles should not specify security and protocol combinations that do not satisfy security best practices
as described in the WoT Security Best Practices document.
There should be a mechanism to allow "nosec" but only in a Developer context (debatable - may still be useful
in a closed network).
