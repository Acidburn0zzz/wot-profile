Hi Sebastian, Taki and all,

After fixing the duplicate dfn-td-processor, I re-generated the static
HTML draft for FPWD publication:
  https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/publication/ver11/1-fpwd/index.html
and have checked the document by:
* Pubrules checker: https://www.w3.org/pubrules/
* Link checker: 1G

I've fixed the following issues #1-6 and the draft should be ready for
publication.

---------------------
Issues already fixed:
---------------------
1. use CSS for WD

2. Nov 24 as the pubdate

3. publish as a FPWD instead of an ED

4. duplicate id "tdd-search-apis-jsonPath"
=> made the second id "tdd-search-apis-jsonPath-"


Thanks,

Kazuyuki
